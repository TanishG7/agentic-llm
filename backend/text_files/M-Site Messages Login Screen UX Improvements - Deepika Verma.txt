Hi All,
We are pleased to inform you that we have updated the UX of the Login  Screen  in the M-Site Messages . 
Business Objective:  
The current Login  UX for identified and unidentified users in M-Site Messages  is not ef fective and has a success rate of just 30%. The objective of this launch is to streamline
and improve the UX of the login  journey . 
What has been done:  
The following changes have been performed:  
1. Implementing autofocus on the input field when the user lands on the unidentifed messages  login  screen. The keypad enter key triggers the OTP and takes the user to the
Enter OTP  screen . The numeric keypad is displayed when the user login s through a phone number , whereas the email login  attempt displays the normal phone keypad to the
user.  
2. Triggering OTP when the user logins from the sources such as Email or SMS, instead of showing the current truecaller API error "Could not fetch through truecaller , please
try login  by entering password or OTP". 
3. Displaying numeric keypad with autofocus on the OTP input field on the Enter OTP  screen  and validating the OTP  as soon as the user enters 4 digit OTP value.
4. Displaying normal phone keypad with autofocus on password input field when the user attempt to login  via password and validating the password with enter key selection on
user's mobile keypad
5. Increased font-size of the Submit OTP button to 16 px and reduced font-size of the Sign in with password button size to 14 px on the Enter OTP  screen .
Note:  If the user tries to log in by clicking the Sign In with OTP Button, the autofocus is not working. The ticket ( 383717 ) is already opened for the same. W e will be fixing it in the
next release.

Just an idea, discard d if already tried 
In case of identified user 
If that user has a verified Gmail Id. 
If Gmail is logged in browser . 
Would login by google be better even for those Indian users.
 
We had tried ture caller as well? 
One tap login if T rucaller was present 
There was another one that was working on carrier based without otp identified verification..

This is present at M-Site Message Login. W e are working to make it more upfront for SMS/Email logins since an external click is either way needed to trigger T rueCaller in these
journeys.
