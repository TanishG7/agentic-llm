Hi everyone,
We are glad to announce that we have ﬁxed the CLS issue on help.im  mobile website.
Business Objective:
To reduce or remove the CLS(Cumulative Layout Shift) that was being experienced by users on the
pages of help.im  mobile site.
What is CLS:
Cumulative Layout Shift  (CLS) is a stable Core Web Vital metric. It's an important, user-centric
metric for measuring visual stability because it helps quantify how often users experience
unexpected layout shifts. A low CLS helps ensure that the page is delightful.
Unexpected layout shifts can disrupt the user experience in many ways, from causing them to lose
their place while reading if the text moves suddenly, to making them click the wrong link or button.
In some cases, this can do serious damage.
The permissible limit is:
For Good CLS it should be within 0.1.1.
If it is between 0.1 and 0.25, it needs improvement.2.
If it is more than 0.25 then it is poor.3.

What has been done:
In our analysis it was concluded that a section of breadcrumbs on the article and category 1.
pages had variable height, which kept changing according to the text in it. We have now kept
the height of this section as ﬁxed, so that its height doesn't change according to the contents in
it. This correction has reduced the shifting by a lot.
In one of our pages, namely ' Indiamart Veriﬁed Exporter Service ', there were third-party fonts 2.
being used. On their load, the content's font was changing and as a result some layout shift was
happening. We have now removed those fonts from that page.

What has been done:

1. In our analysis it was concluded that a section of breadcrumbs on the article and category
pages had variable height, which kept changing according to the text in it. We have now kept
the height of this section as fixed, so that its height doesn't change according to the contents in
it. This correction has reduced the shifting by a lot.

2. In one of our pages, namely 'Indiamart Verified Exporter Service’, there were third-party fonts
being used. On their load, the content's font was changing and as a result some layout shift was
happening. We have now removed those fonts from that page.

What to test:
There should be no layout shifts on help article pages on mobile.1.
Way ahead:
We shall be working tirelessly on other web vitals that are not in good range for both help desktop
and mobile site.
Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) - Mobile and desktop1.
Interaction to Next Paint (INP) - Mobile2.
CLS - Desktop3.
Our priority would be to solve the issues of the mobile site first as we currently have 0 good URLs
there. Also google primarily crawls the mobile site.
Apart from the above, we shall also check if third-party fonts are used on other pages as well.
Word of thanks:
This goal would not have been achievable without the following people:
@Jatin Chitkara  for being a great help in identifying the issues and deﬁning the actionables.
@Aditya Kunwar  from the help team for his insights and co-ordination.
@Aakanksha Gupta , @Pradeep Chopra  and @Nikhil Prabhakar  for their continued support and
guidance.
