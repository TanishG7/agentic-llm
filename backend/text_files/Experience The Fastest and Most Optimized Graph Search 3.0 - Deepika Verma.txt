Hi All,
We are pleased to inform you that Graph Search 3.0  has been made live for MCA T Prediction. 
In this major update, Graph Search 3.0 has been optimized with a new schema architecture  that promises a blazing fast speed,  scale, and
performance.
What has been Done?
We have refactored the Current Graph Schema by separating the Keyword property from the Product Node and revamped the queries
for traversing the Graph Model and Index.  
PFB the previous and new schema of the Graph Search Model

Key Areas of Impact
1. Reduction in A verage Response T ime
2. Optimization in Graph Index size and traversal logic
The Graph FTS Index size has been reduced from 10.7 cr to 3.5 cr without any impact on the training dataset.
Better Graph traversal leads to achieving better results at a faster speed.
3. Ability to handle additional training data and more user requests
The graph is now capable of handling additional training data from multiple sources like ISQs, BL, Site Search, etc. without any impact on
load and response time which will help to achieve the future roadmaps for Graph Search.
