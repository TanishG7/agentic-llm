Hi team,
We are glad to announce that we have reduced 301 redirects on help.im .
Business Objective:
To reduce workable 301 redirects on help.im .
How was it earlier:
Previously we were getting close to 600 redirects weekly which were coming through help chatbot,
internally from article and video pages, and on the login URL of help mobile site.
What has been done:
We have removed the wrong URLs which were being hit without a trailing slash,1.
e.g. /knowledge-base/paid-services-of-indiamart, and changed it to:  /knowledge-base/paid-
services-of-indiamart/  with a trailing slash at the end.
We have also removed the wrong URL /knowledge-base/lms-crm-integration/ and changed it to the 2.
correct URL to which it was redirecting to: /knowledge-base/lms-crm-integration-v2/
We have also changed the URL of login page of the help mobile site. Earlier it was /login 3.
which on refresh would redirect to /knowledge-base/login/  due to helpguru theme's setting,
and changed it to /log-in  so that it doesn't get redirected.
Go live date:
This was accomplished gradually over a week's time. The ﬁnal change was done on 28-May-2024.
Ticket:  507580
What to test:
There should be no redirections for the following URLs in their respective sources:
